  "readme": "box-intersect\n=============\nThis modules finds all intersection in a set of n boxes in d-dimensions, or between a pair of sets with n and m boxes respectively.  The time taken is O((n+m) log^d(n+m)) and the algorithm uses a temporary scratch memory of size O(n+m).  This memory is pooled so that after the first execution no additional memory is allocated.  Some possible applications of this library include:\n\n* Collision detection\n* Polygon clipping\n* Batched box stabbing queries\n* Mesh boolean operations (CSG)\n\nThe algorithm in this package is based on the one described in the following paper:\n\n* [A. Zomorodian, H. Edelsbrunner. (2000) \"Software for fast box intersections\" In proceedings of SoCG](http://pub.ist.ac.at/~edels/Papers/2002-J-01-FastBoxIntersection.pdf)\n\nA detailed experimental analysis of the performance of this module as well as comparisons with other libraries for box intersection can be found in the following repository: \n\n* [The Great JavaScript Box Intersection Benchmark](https://github.com/mikolalysenko/box-intersect-benchmark)\n\nFor more information on this problem, please see the following series of blog posts:\n\n* [Collision detection (part 1)](http://0fps.net/2015/01/07/collision-detection-part-1/)\n* [Collision detection (part 2)](http://0fps.net/2015/01/18/collision-detection-part-2/)\n* [Collision detection (part 3)](http://0fps.net/2015/01/23/collision-detection-part-3-benchmarks/)\n\n# Example\n\n### Detecting overlaps in a set of boxes\n\nHere is how to detect all pairs of overlapping boxes in a single set of boxes:\n\n```javascript\nvar boxIntersect = require('box-intersect')\n\n//Boxes are listed as flattened 2*d length arrays\nvar boxes = [\n  [1, 1, 2, 2],   //Interpretation: [minX, minY, maxX, maxY]\n  [0, -1, 3, 2],\n  [2, 1, 4, 5],\n  [0.5, 3, 1, 10]\n]\n\n//Default behavior reports list of intersections\nconsole.log('overlaps:', boxIntersect(boxes))\n\n//Note:  Boxes are closed\n\n//Can also use a visitor to report all crossings\nvar result = boxIntersect(boxes, function(i,j) {\n  console.log('overlap:', boxes[i], boxes[j])\n\n  //Can early out by returning any value\n  if(i === 2 || j === 2) {\n    return 2\n  }\n})\n\nconsole.log('early out result:', result)\n```\n\n#### Output\n\n```\noverlap: [ [ 0, 1 ], [ 0, 2 ], [ 1, 2 ] ]\noverlap: [ 1, 1, 2, 2 ] [ 0, -1, 3, 2 ]\noverlap: [ 1, 1, 2, 2 ] [ 2, 1, 4, 5 ]\nearly out result: 2\n```\n\n### Bipartite intersection\n\nYou can also detect all intersections between two different sets of boxes:\n\n```javascript\nvar boxIntersect = require('box-intersect')\n\n//Again, boxes are given as flattened lists of coordinates\nvar red = [\n  [0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 1],  //Format: [minX, minY, minZ, maxX, maxY, maxZ]\n  [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 1],\n  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 8]\n]\n\nvar blue = [\n  [5, 0, 0, 6, 10, 10],\n  [0, 5, 0, 10, 6, 10],\n  [0, 0, 5, 10, 10, 10]\n]\n\n//Report all crossings\nconsole.log('crossings=', boxIntersect(red, blue))\n\n//Again can use a visitor.  Also possible to use lower overhead direct wrapper.\nboxIntersect.direct(red, blue, function(r, b) {\n  console.log('overlap:', red[r], blue[b])\n})\n```\n\n#### Output\n\n```\ncrossings= [ [ 0, 0 ], [ 1, 1 ], [ 2, 2 ] ]\noverlap: [ 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 1 ] [ 5, 0, 0, 6, 10, 10 ]\noverlap: [ 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 1 ] [ 0, 5, 0, 10, 6, 10 ]\noverlap: [ 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 8 ] [ 0, 0, 5, 10, 10, 10 ]\n```\n\n# Install\n\nUsing [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/), just run the following command:\n\n```sh\nnpm install box-intersect\n```\n\nThis module works in any reasonable CommonJS environment, such as browsersify, iojs or node.js.\n\n# API\n\n```javascript\nvar boxIntersect = require('box-intersect')\n```\n\n### `boxIntersect(boxes[, otherBoxes, visit])`\n\nFinds all pairs intersections in a set of boxes.  There are two basic modes of operation for this function:\n\n* `complete` which detects all pairs of intersections within a single set of boxes\n* `bipartite` which detects pairs of intersections between two different sets of boxes\n\nThe parameters to the function are as follows:\n\n* `boxes` is a list of boxes.  Boxes are represented as length 2*d arrays where the first d-components are the lower bound of the box and then the next d components are the upper bound.\n* `otherBoxes` is an optional list of boxes which `boxes` is tested against.  If not specified, then the algorithm will report self intersections in `boxes`\n* `visit(i,j)` is a callback which is called once for each overlapping pair of boxes.  If `visit` returns any value not equal to `undefined`, then the search is terminated immediately and this value is returned.  If `visit` is not specified, then a list of intersecting pairs is returned.\n\n**Returns** If `visit` was specified, then the last returned value of `visit`.  Otherwise an array of pairs of intersecting boxes.\n\n**Note** The boxes are treated as cartesian products of *closed* intervals.  For example, the boxes `[1,1,2,2]` and `[0,0,1,1]` will be reported as intersecting by this module.\n\n# License\n\n(c) 2014 Mikola Lysenko. MIT License",
